## 3. Data Usage

SpeedBump stores minimal data as described in its [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/ThreadedTickets/speedbump/blob/master/PRIVACY.md).  
All stored data is related to server configurations — including **guild IDs**, **channel IDs**, and **slowmode rules**.  
No message content, usernames, or other personal user data is stored.

By using the Bot, you consent to the processing of this limited data as required for the Bot’s functionality.

## 4. Availability and Changes

SpeedBump is provided **“as is”** and may be modified, updated, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.  
The developer makes no guarantees of uptime, data preservation, or feature availability.

## 5. Termination

The developer reserves the right to remove or restrict the Bot from any server or user at any time for misuse, abuse, or violation of these Terms.  
You may remove the Bot from your server at any time to stop using the service.

## 6. Liability

The developer is **not responsible** for any damages, losses, or disruptions caused by the use (or inability to use) SpeedBump.  
Use of the Bot is at your own risk.
